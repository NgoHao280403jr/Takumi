Fluorine-based resins are generally considered the source of corrosive chemical components, but they can also appear in many mixed resins and aromatic resins called super engineering plastics. This phenomenon often leads to pitted metal surfaces, and the reason the screw tip is prone to wear is because it is the part that reaches the highest temperature during molding. The most effective countermeasure against corrosive wear is to replace the screw, cylinder and other parts with steel materials with excellent corrosion resistance.",
  "adhesive_wear": "Adhesive wear occurs when the screw and cylinder surfaces come into metal contact due to resin adhesion, etc. If molding conditions are not suitable for the molding resin, local friction occurs due to screw rotation, causing the outer circumference of the screw check ring to contact the inner surface of the cylinder, causing the hard layer to peel off. To avoid this, we believe it is necessary to change the screw and cylinder material combination, as well as change the screw design relative to the molding resin. Also, note that center alignment during assembly of parts has a significant impact.",

  "problems_goals": "Problems and Goals",
  "mixing_issue_intro": "We often hear about molding problems due to insufficient mixing. It is known that insufficient mixing can be solved by adding mixing structures to the screw.",
  "mixing_issue_detail": "However, choosing the wrong mixing structure can lead to burning, contamination, and product damage. Furthermore, when changing screw design, the balance between the feed zone (feed zone), compression zone (compression zone, taper zone) and metering zone (uniform melting zone, metering zone), as well as volume compression ratio (VCR) and effective length (L/D) are also important factors. While integrating mixing structures into the nozzle is also an effective method, we believe that mixing in the nozzle is unnecessary if the screw can perform mixing and melting theoretically. This is because we believe that unnecessary mixing can cause burning if mixing and melting can be performed in a fast cycle. At Watanabe Seisakusho, we are committed to designing that allows mixing and melting even when cycles are shortened.",
  "mixing_issue_example": "For example, when molding PP with 2% masterbatch, using single screws, single-flight screws often leads to color unevenness. Therefore, mixing components like Dulmage, Maddock or pin-type screws are often integrated into screws. While any mixing structure can improve color unevenness and melting phenomena, if the selection reason is not clearly determined, it can lead to other molding defects such as burning and contamination. Increasing the effective length (L/D) of the screw is also a good idea, but this has limitations when using existing molding or extrusion machines.",
  "mixing_issue_solution": "Therefore, Watanabe Manufacturing has analyzed each mixing structure to improve mixing and melting processes, while considering volume compression ratios as a design less likely to cause burning or contamination defects. We have proposed using two-stage mixing for mixing sections and have solved many mixing and non-melting problems.",
  "mixing_issue_conclusion": "Below is an introduction to steel material selection and basic concepts of each part when designing and manufacturing Watanabe Seisakusho's original designs to improve mixing and melting processes.",
  "steel_selection_title": "1. Steel Selection",
  "steel_selection_text": "When considering improvements to mixing and melting processes, steel material selection must be considered before design. Stable molding cannot be expected if resin is not melted without hindering its flow. Regardless of this problem, selecting steel materials that allow resin to slip easily (high slip type) is a fundamental factor in plastic molding, and is a very important factor.",

  "mixing_setting_title": "1. Mixing Setting",
  "mixing_setting_text": "Considering burning/contamination defects, high cycle time and output volume, it is best not to use mixing structures, but this is a necessary factor to prevent color unevenness and melting. Watanabe Manufacturing considers burning/contamination, product degradation, cycle time and, in the case of extruders, output volume and believes that two-stage mixing is optimal. Dulmage-Madock type does not improve mixing ability; it only retains resin, leading to color unevenness and melting; it does not transport resin while being discharged. When using Dulmage-Madock type, burning/contamination defects increase. Since double-flight has a structure with flights between single flights, it is designed to enhance mixing while transporting, resulting in fewer product defects due to resin retention compared to Dulmage-Madock type.",
  "volume_compression_ratio_title": "2. Volume Compression Ratio (VCR)",
  "volume_compression_ratio_text1": "Traditional screw design emphasized compression ratio. However, compression ratio is only for reference when considering all screws of the same shape. However, since the length and design of each zone (metering area, compression area and feed area) actually differ, determining compression ratio only by the height difference between metering area and feed area is insufficient. Therefore, Watanabe Manufacturing considers volume compression ratio as the resin volume per lead and designs screws accordingly. High volume compression ratio can solve problems like color unevenness and melting phenomena, but if too high, the possibility of resin retention is very high. Similar to the Dalmage-Madock method in mixing ratio selection, these problems are ultimately solved by retaining resin, but burning and contamination defects will increase. Furthermore, if the volume compression ratio is too low, resin pressure will be too low, which also causes resin retention and makes resin more prone to burning. In the case of extruders, this also leads to low output.",

  "high_mixing_screw_text": "Watanabe Manufacturing's high mixing screws consider the balance of feed zone (feed zone), compression zone (compression zone, taper resin zone) and metering zone (uniform melting zone, metering zone) and set appropriate volume compression ratios, while proposing designs that improve mixing ability with double flights.",

Since resin transported from the screw body must be delivered to the nozzle smoothly, the accuracy of the contact surface between the ring and seat, as well as the clearance between the inner diameter of the ring and the outer diameter of the screw tip, significantly affects contamination due to burning. As you know, wear on the outer diameter of the ring significantly affects mold accuracy.\nAlthough considered a replaceable part, this is an important component that supports screw cylinder performance and is a key factor in achieving stable production in fully automated systems. Contact performance between nozzle and mold ultimately requires no resin leakage during injection. Wear at the tip and wear at the tip hole can cause various adverse effects. Resin accumulation on the inner diameter of the nozzle leads to contamination due to burning, so nozzles made from materials with good characteristics are necessary.",

This leads to increased diversity of available resin types and we believe screw design must keep up. Watanabe Manufacturing has collaborated with chemical manufacturers for about 15 years. Based on the enormous amount of resin data provided by these manufacturers, we have designed and manufactured various screws that solve molding problems based on scientific evidence, taking into account the characteristics of many different resins. By designing and manufacturing various design screws, we have understood the importance of completely melting resins. However, without understanding resin characteristics, it is impossible to design a screw that maintains complete resin melting. Although each resin has different characteristics, contamination problems due to burning can be solved by properly melting resins.",

  "compression_zone_desc": "It is important to completely melt the resin that has been compressed to a certain melting degree in the supply section in the taper section of the compression section. Not completely melting resin in the compression section can lead to stagnation, insufficient mixing and gas and moisture flowing forward. Therefore, Watanabe Manufacturing minimizes clearances and designs screws so that only molten resin or resin just before melting flows forward. Furthermore, sudden compression in the compression section can cause resin to stagnate and burn, so gradual compression is better. This increases resin density, allowing gas and moisture to escape later and preventing them from being mixed into products. Complete melting in the compression section is the most important aspect of screw design.",

  "three_parts_design_title": "4. Three Parts Design",
  "three_parts_design_desc": "Even with perfect screw design, if the three components are poorly designed, these parts can cause defects. It is important to prevent resin accumulation, so design requires large clearances between check ring and seat ring for resin to be transported smoothly from the screw. Clearance between the inner diameter of the check ring and outer diameter of the screw tip also needs to be considered. If the amount of resin passing through is small, resin will get stuck, causing burning and other problems. It is also important to be careful to minimize clearance between check ring and cylinder. Accuracy of the contact surface between check ring and seat ring is also very important.",

  "screw_selection_text": "Recent rapid advances in engineering plastics have led to their application in many types of critical safety components, from automotive engine parts to aircraft engines. The rapid development of new resin types, with more demanding requirements has led to increasing use of resins as functional components. Of course, we recommend using corrosion and wear resistant materials for screws and cylinders, ensuring fully automated production time even in the shortest possible time. However, there are many types of corrosion and wear resistant materials, so we recommend selecting the right screw and cylinder materials for the type of resin being molded or extruded. Super wear resistant materials are not necessary for resins with GF around 30%. Even with high GF, resins that do not generate corrosive gases do not require high corrosion resistant materials. If you encounter difficult-to-mold resins, a simple change in screw design can significantly improve molding results. Even small changes are welcome. Please consult Watanabe Seisakusho's experts.",
